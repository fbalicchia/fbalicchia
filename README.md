- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fbalicchia
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an AI/ML-powered assistant for a Location Intelligence platform, built on top of Kubernetes and leveraging open-source technologies.
- ðŸŒ± â€œIâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge in applying LLMs to real-world applications (such as RAG systems, agents, etc.), and I enjoy reading research papers and implementing themâ€”especially those based on Transformer architectures.
